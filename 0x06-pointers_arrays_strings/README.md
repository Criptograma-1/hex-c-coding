## Tasks

0. strcat (```0-strcat.c```) - a function that concatenates two strings. 
1. strncat (```1-strncat.c```) - a function that concatenates two strings.
2. strncpy (```2-strncpy.c```) - a function that copies a string.
3. strcmp (```3-strcmp.c```) - a function that compares two strings.
4. I am a kind of paranoid in reverse. I suspect people of plotting to make me happy (```4-rev_array.c```) - a function that reverses the content of an array of integers.
5. Always look up (```5-string_toupper.c```) - a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
6. Expect the best. Prepare for the worst. Capitalize on what comes (```6-cap_string.c```) - a function that capitalizes all words of a string.
