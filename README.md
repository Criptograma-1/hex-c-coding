### 0x00. C - Hello, World ###

0. Name (`0-name`): Write a script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun`.
1. Hello, puts (`1-puts.c`): Write a C program that prints exactly `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle`, followed by a new line.

>* Use the function puts
>* You are not allowed to use `printf`
>* Your program should end with the value 0

2. Hello, printf (`2-printf.c`): Write a C program that prints exactly `with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,`, followed by a new line.

>* Use the function `printf`
>* You are not allowed to use the function `puts`
>* Your program should return `0`
>* Your program should compile without warning when using the `-Wall` `gcc` option

3. Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation (`3-size.c`): Write a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.

>* You should produce the exact same output as in the example
>* Warnings are allowed
>* Your program should return `0`
>* In the Sandbox, everything is installed for you - but if you want to test in your computer, you might have to install the package `libc6-``dev-i386` to test the `-m32` `gcc` option
