### 0x03-debugging ###
#### Learning Objectives ####
* What is debugging
* What are some methods of debugging manually
* How to read the error messages
#### Tasks ####
0. [Multiple mains][1] (`0-main.c, holberton.h`): 
* In most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a `postitive_or_negative()` function similar to the one you worked with in an [earlier C project][5]
1. [Like, comment, subscribe][2] (`1-main.c`): 
* Copy this main file. Comment out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
2. [0 > 972?][3] (`2-largest_number.c, holberton.h`): 
* Fix the code in `2-largest_number.c` so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.
3. [Leap year][4] (`3-print_remaining_days.c, holberton.h`): 
* Fix the `print_remaining_days()` function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
