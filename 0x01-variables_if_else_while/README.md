0. [Positive anything is better than negative nothing][1] (`0-positive_or_negative.c`): 
* This program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable `n` is positive or negative.
1. [The last digit][2] (`1-last_digit.c`): 
* This program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable `n`.
2. [I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game][3] (`2-print_alphabet.c`): 
* Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
3. [alphABET][4] (`3-print_alphabets.c`): 
* Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.
4. [When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off][4] (`4-print_alphabt.c`): 
* Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
5. [Numbers][4] (`5-print_numbers.c`): 
* Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
6. [Numberz][4] (`6-print_numberz.c`): 
* Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
7. [Smile in the mirror][4] (`7-print_tebahpla.c`): 
* Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line..
8. [Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success][4] (`8-print_comb.c`): 
* Write a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
